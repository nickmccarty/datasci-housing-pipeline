The project site slopes up from south to north. In addition, the project site slopes up from east to west. The site is currently occupied by a two-story-over-basement, 50-foot tall building containing an automobile dealership and showroom. The proposed project would renovate the interior of the building and convert the existing automobile dealership and showroom to a health club containing exercise equipment, group fitness rooms and locker room spaces, a lounge, restaurant, and indoor pool on the second floor. In addition, the project proposes to convert a portion of the roof above the proposed swimming pool into a retractable roof. There would be no physical expansion of the existing building envelope. The health club would occupy approximately 39,940 square feet in the basement, ground, and second floors. Approximately 1,500 square feet of the basement level would be retained as a loading dock; the remainder of the basement would be converted to health club use. The project would reduce the total number of vehicular parking spaces on-site from 19 to 0, allowing only for bicycle parking and storage. The proposed project would comply with bicycle parking requirements. The project would excavate no more than 49 cubic yards of soil to a maximum depth of 20 below ground for foundation work. Construction activities primarily consist of interior work for new partitions, a new pool and jacuzzi area, restroom and locker areas, restaurant fit-out, and interior finishes. Some rooftop work, including construction of the retractable roof and installation of new HVAC equipment, would also be required.
